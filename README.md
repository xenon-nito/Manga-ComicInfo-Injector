# ðŸ“š Manga ComicInfo Injector

**Manga ComicInfo Injector** is a Python desktop tool for automatically fetching metadata from [AniList](https://anilist.co/) and injecting it into your `.cbz` and `.cbr` manga/comic archives in the **ComicInfo.xml** format (with optional cover image).  
This makes your manga library richer, better organized, and compatible with comic library managers like **Kavita**, **ComicRack**, and **Komga**.
